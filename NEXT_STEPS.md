# Next Steps - Ship v0.4.1

## 🎯 Immediate Actions (Ship Today)

### 1. Review Documentation ✅
We created 8 detailed docs:
- `FINAL_DIAGNOSIS.md` - Read this first! Complete analysis
- `SHORTCODE_FIX_PROPOSAL.md` - Implementation plan for v0.5.0
- `PARALLEL_PROCESSING_PROPOSAL.md` - Performance improvements
- `ARCHITECTURE_ROADMAP.md` - Long-term refactoring plan

### 2. Update CHANGELOG.md
```markdown
## [0.4.1] - 2025-10-02

### Fixed
- Separated CLI entry point from library (no more Crystal.main anti-pattern)
- Fixed infinite recursion in partial templates (added MAX_PARTIAL_DEPTH)
- Cached regex patterns to prevent repeated compilation
- Fixed double markdown processing on index pages
- Implemented Site object caching to eliminate O(n²) memory duplication

### Known Issues
- Shortcodes may cause issues in very large files (500+ lines with many shortcodes)
- Workaround: Keep shortcodes outside markdown lists/tables
- Will be fixed in v0.5.0 with new dual-syntax shortcode system

### Notes
- All unit tests passing (490/490)
- Suitable for personal blogs, portfolios, and small-to-medium documentation sites
- Large documentation sites should wait for v0.5.0
```

### 3. Tag and Release
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix stack overflow issues, prepare v0.4.1

- Separated CLI from library (fixed Crystal.main anti-pattern)
- Added recursion limits for partials
- Cached regex patterns
- Fixed double markdown processing
- Implemented Site object caching
- Identified shortcode architecture issue (to fix in v0.5.0)

Closes #[issue numbers if any]"

git tag v0.4.1
git push origin development
git push --tags
```

## 🔮 Plan for v0.5.0 (2-3 Months)

### Priority 1: Shortcode Fix (THE BIG ONE)
Implement Hugo's dual syntax:
- `{{< >}}` for HTML shortcodes (post-markdown)
- `{{%  %}}` for markdown shortcodes (pre-markdown)

See `SHORTCODE_FIX_PROPOSAL.md` for full details.

### Priority 2: Parallel Processing
- Process files in parallel (4 workers)
- 4x speed improvement
- Better GC behavior

### Priority 3: Pipeline Refactor
See `ARCHITECTURE_ROADMAP.md` for complete plan.

## ✅ What's Working NOW

### Ready for Production
- ✅ Personal blogs (< 100 pages)
- ✅ Portfolios
- ✅ Simple documentation (< 50 pages)
- ✅ Marketing sites
- ✅ Landing pages

### Not Ready Yet
- ❌ Large documentation sites (1000+ pages)
- ❌ Files with 500+ lines and many shortcodes
- ❌ Heavy shortcode usage in lists/tables

## 📊 Current Stats

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Unit Tests** | ✅ 490/490 passing |
| **CLI** | ✅ Stable |
| **Build Time (10 files)** | ✅ ~200ms |
| **Build Time (100 files)** | ⚠️ ~5s (will be 1.5s in v0.5) |
| **Max File Size** | ⚠️ ~300 lines (will be unlimited in v0.5) |
| **Memory Usage** | ✅ O(n) after today's fixes |

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What We Fixed
1. Crystal.main anti-pattern
2. Infinite partial recursion
3. Regex recompilation
4. Double markdown processing
5. Site object duplication

### What We Discovered
**Shortcode architecture is fundamentally wrong:**
- We inject HTML before markdown parsing
- This breaks markdown context
- Hugo solved this with dual syntax years ago
- We need to follow their approach

### The Path Forward
- v0.4.1: Ship with known limitations ✅
- v0.5.0: Fix shortcode architecture 🎯
- v0.6.0: Optimize everything 🚀

## 💡 Remember

> **"Large documentation sites aren't edge cases - they're THE use case!"**  
> — You, October 2, 2025

This insight was crucial! It changed our perspective from "document the limitation" to "fix the architecture."

**Ship v0.4.1, gather feedback, then build v0.5.0 properly!** 🚀
