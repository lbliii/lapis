# Lapis Stability Analysis - October 2, 2025

## Executive Summary

This analysis was performed to evaluate the current state of the Lapis static site generator (v0.4.0) and identify critical issues blocking stability and release readiness.

**Status**: üî¥ **CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND** - Not ready for stable release

---

## Test Suite Results

### ‚úÖ Unit Tests: **PASSING**
- **490 examples, 0 failures** 
- All unit tests pass successfully after fixing:
  - Missing `with_gc_disabled` method in MemoryManager
  - Duplicate `debug` methods in Site and Page classes (Bool vs String return types)
  - Built-in colorize dependency removed from shard.yml

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Integration & Functional Tests: **16 FAILURES**
- **559 examples, 16 failures, 0 errors**
- Failures primarily in:
  - Generator build process
  - Template engine integration  
  - Debug partial rendering
  - Build workflow tests
  - Incremental and parallel builds

**Common failure pattern**: Generated output files not found at expected paths (e.g., `/2024/01/15/test-post/index.html`)

## üö® CRITICAL BUGS IDENTIFIED

### 1. **Stack Overflow in GC System** (SEVERITY: CRITICAL)
**Status**: Confirmed, reproducible, pre-existing

#### Symptoms:
- Stack overflow occurs during program execution, even for simple commands like `--version`
- ~52,000+ recursive calls in GC push_roots
- Binary partially works but crashes during cleanup

#### Stack Trace Evidence:
```
Stack overflow (e.g., infinite or very deep recursion)
[0x104de06b0] ~procProc(Nil)@.../gc/boehm.cr:482 (52257 times)
[0x10582778c] GC_push_roots +572
```

#### Root Cause Analysis:
- Likely circular reference in data structures causing infinite GC traversal
- Happens during garbage collection marking phase
- Not introduced by recent changes - exists in previous builds

#### Impact:
- **HIGH**: Program crashes after execution but does complete intended operations
- Makes debugging difficult
- Could indicate memory leaks or data corruption

### 2. **Stack Overflow in Markdown Parser** (SEVERITY: CRITICAL)
**Status**: Confirmed during build operations

#### Symptoms:
- Infinite recursion in Markd library's `parse_blocks` method
- Occurs during content processing in `load_all_content`
- Prevents successful site builds

#### Stack Trace Evidence:
```
[0x1050bd57c] *Markd::Parser::Block#parse_blocks<String>:Nil +580
[0x104e20298] *String#unsafe_byte_slice_string<Int32, Int32, Int32>:String +48
```

#### Root Cause:
- Markdown content in example site triggers infinite recursion
- Possibly malformed markdown or edge case in Markd library
- String slicing operations in tight recursive loop

#### Impact:
- **CRITICAL**: Prevents building sites with certain markdown content
- Blocks core functionality
- Makes lapis unusable for real-world projects

## Issues Fixed During Analysis

### ‚úÖ 1. Missing MemoryManager Method
- **Issue**: Test called `with_gc_disabled` which didn't exist
- **Fix**: Implemented method with proper GC enable/disable logic
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved

### ‚úÖ 2. Duplicate debug Methods
- **Issue**: Site and Page classes had two `debug` methods with different return types (Bool vs String)
- **Impact**: Method collision caused wrong method to be called, breaking template rendering
- **Fix**: 
  - Renamed debug info method to `debug_info`
  - Kept `debug` as Bool property for config.debug
  - Updated function processor and template methods
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved

### ‚úÖ 3. Built-in Dependency
- **Issue**: colorize listed as external dependency but is now built into Crystal stdlib
- **Fix**: Removed from shard.yml
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved

### ‚úÖ 4. Performance Test Helpers
- **Issue**: File misnamed as `_spec.cr` instead of `.cr`
- **Fix**: Renamed to correct filename
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved

### ‚úÖ 5. Spec Helper Typo
- **Issue**: Called `get_shared_generator` instead of `shared_generator`
- **Fix**: Corrected method name
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved

---

## Template Engine Status

### Functionality Check

**Template Variable Processing**: ‚úÖ **WORKING**
- Site variables (`{{ site.title }}`, `{{ site.debug }}`, etc.) render correctly
- Page variables (`{{ page.kind }}`, `{{ page.debug }}`, etc.) work properly
- Debug info accessible via `{{ site.debug_info }}` and `{{ page.debug_info }}`

**Known Limitations**:
- Cannot fully test template engine due to markdown parsing crashes
- Integration tests fail because builds don't complete
- Need to fix markdown parser before comprehensive template testing

---

## Build System Status

### What Works:
- ‚úÖ Binary compiles successfully
- ‚úÖ CLI responds to commands
- ‚úÖ Version information displays (with crash after)
- ‚úÖ Unit test compilation and execution

### What's Broken:
- ‚ùå Site building fails with stack overflow
- ‚ùå Content loading triggers markdown parser recursion
- ‚ùå Example site cannot be built
- ‚ùå Integration tests fail due to build failures

---

## Critical Path to Stability

### Priority 1: Fix Markdown Parser Stack Overflow
**Blockers**: Cannot build sites, blocks all functionality

**Action Items**:
1. Identify problematic markdown content in exampleSite
2. Test with minimal markdown to isolate issue
3. Consider upgrading Markd dependency or implementing safeguards
4. Add recursion depth limits
5. Validate all markdown content before parsing

### Priority 2: Fix GC Stack Overflow  
**Blockers**: Makes debugging difficult, indicates potential memory issues

**Action Items**:
1. Audit global variables and module-level initialization
2. Look for circular references in Site/Page/Content classes
3. Review MemoryManager implementation
4. Consider lazy initialization of large data structures
5. Add GC pressure monitoring and limits

### Priority 3: Fix Integration Test Failures
**Blockers**: Cannot verify system works end-to-end

**Dependencies**: Requires Priority 1 & 2 to be fixed first

**Action Items**:
1. Re-run tests after markdown fix
2. Verify output path generation
3. Check permalink/URL generation logic
4. Validate file writing operations
5. Test incremental and parallel builds

### Priority 4: Comprehensive Testing
**Action Items**:
1. Test template engine with various content types
2. Validate all shortcodes
3. Test multi-format output (HTML, JSON, RSS, etc.)
4. Performance testing
5. Memory leak detection

## Risk Assessment

| Issue | Severity | Impact | Effort to Fix | Risk Level |
|-------|----------|--------|---------------|------------|

## Timeline to Stability

### Optimistic: **1-2 Weeks**
- Markdown issue is simple configuration or content problem
- GC issue can be worked around
- Integration tests pass after markdown fix

### Realistic: **2-4 Weeks**
- Need to patch or fork Markd library
- GC issue requires refactoring
- Some integration tests need updating

### Pessimistic: **1-2 Months**
- Fundamental architecture issues
- Need to replace Markd library
- Extensive refactoring required

---

## Dependencies & External Factors

### Markd Library (v0.5.0)
- **Status**: Potential bug in recursion handling
- **Options**:
  1. Upgrade to newer version
  2. Report bug upstream
  3. Fork and patch
  4. Switch to different markdown library

### Crystal GC
- **Status**: Potential interaction issue with data structures
- **Options**:
  1. Use different GC mode (`--gc=none` for testing)
  2. Reduce object graph complexity
  3. Implement manual memory management in hot paths

---

## Conclusion

**Lapis is NOT production-ready** in its current state. Two critical stack overflow bugs prevent basic functionality. However, the core architecture is sound - unit tests pass, and the template system works correctly.

**Recommendation**: **DO NOT RELEASE** until Priority 1 and Priority 2 issues are resolved.

The good news: The issues are isolated and identifiable. With focused effort, the project can reach stability within 2-4 weeks.

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Completed**: Full test suite analysis
2. ‚úÖ **Completed**: Critical bug identification  
3. **TODO**: Create minimal reproduction case for markdown crash
4. **TODO**: Implement immediate fixes
5. **TODO**: Re-run full test suite
6. **TODO**: Update this document with results
